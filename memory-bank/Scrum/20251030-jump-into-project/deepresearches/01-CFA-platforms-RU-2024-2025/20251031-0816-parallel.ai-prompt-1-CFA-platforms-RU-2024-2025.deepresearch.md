# DFA-MVP 2025: Как запустить санкционно-устойчивую платформу на Permissioned Ethereum и пройти ЦБ за 6 месяцев

## Executive Summary

The Russian Digital Financial Assets (DFA) landscape in 2024-2025 is defined by two powerful, intersecting forces: explosive market growth and an absolute mandate for financial sovereignty. [executive_summary.overview[1]][1] The market, governed by Federal Law No. 259-FZ, has expanded ninefold to nearly 600 billion rubles, dominated by major financial institutions. Concurrently, the Digital Ruble (CBDC) project is accelerating towards a 2025 public launch, positioning it as the future settlement layer for domestic and cross-border trade, particularly within the BRICS bloc. 

For any new Minimum Viable Product (MVP) entering this arena, the path to success is narrow and dictated by compliance. The central challenge is not choosing a ledger, but building a sanctions-resilient technology stack that can pass the stringent, multi-layered certification process mandated by Russian regulators, including the Bank of Russia, the FSB, and FSTEC.

### Key Findings and Strategic Imperatives

* **GOST Cryptography is Non-Negotiable; Ledger Choice is Secondary**: All DFA platforms must use Russian GOST cryptographic standards for all legally significant operations. This requires deep integration with domestic, FSB-certified Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Since no foreign open-source ledger like Hyperledger Besu or Fabric supports this out-of-the-box, the primary technical hurdle and first priority for any MVP is a Proof of Concept that validates GOST-compliant signing via a domestic HSM. The choice of ledger is a secondary decision, contingent on this primary compliance gate.
* **Sanctions on DFA Operators Mandate a 'Domestic-First' Stack**: The March 2024 US sanctions on existing Russian DFA operators (Atomyze, Lighthouse, Masterchain) confirm that this infrastructure is a geopolitical target. A sanctions-resilient architecture is not optional; it is the only viable long-term strategy. This mandates a "domestic-first" policy, prioritizing certified Russian platforms like Masterchain, self-hosted open-source software, and Russian cloud infrastructure to eliminate reliance on Western vendors.
* **The Digital Ruble is the Strategic Settlement Layer for 2026 and Beyond**: While commercial bank money is the mature settlement option for 2025, the Digital Ruble is the clear strategic successor. With a planned public launch in 2025 and mandatory adoption starting in 2026, its low transaction fees, high speed, and immunity to SWIFT-based sanctions make it the only viable option for cross-border settlements and the most efficient for domestic DvP. MVP architecture must be designed with a "dual-rail" settlement capability from the outset.
* **DFA Market Explodes Ninefold, Creating Opportunity in a Fragmented Landscape**: The DFA market's rapid growth to nearly **600 billion rubles** in 2024 signals massive demand. However, the market is highly fragmented, with each major operator functioning as a silo. This creates a significant opportunity for new entrants who can provide superior user experience, specialized asset classes, or bridge liquidity between platforms.

### Key Risks and Mitigation

| Risk Category | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Regulatory & Compliance** | Failure to meet the complex, multi-layered requirements from the Bank of Russia, FSB (crypto certification), FSTEC (InfoSec), and Rosfinmonitoring (AML/CFT). The FSB certification is a major, time-consuming, and costly hurdle. | Retain specialized Russian legal counsel from day one. Design the platform for auditability, with immutable logging and evidence retention for all critical actions. Prioritize a PoC to validate GOST crypto integration with a domestic HSM. |
| **Sanctions** | Direct sanctions on the platform or its partners, or supply-chain cutoffs for any Western commercial or unsupported open-source software. | Strictly avoid Western commercial software. Use self-hosted open-source tools (e.g., GitLab CE, Kafka, Prometheus) on Russian cloud infrastructure (e.g., Yandex Cloud). Maintain local forks of critical open-source projects. |
| **Technical Integration** | The complexity of integrating non-standard GOST cryptography with DLTs like Besu. Performance uncertainty due to a lack of public benchmarks for Russian data centers and HSMs. A persistent shortage of specialized blockchain developers. | Adopt a modular, microservices architecture using standard interfaces (PKCS#11 for HSMs). Conduct mandatory, extensive load testing on the target Russian data center and HSM. Partner with established Russian system integrators to mitigate the talent shortage. |
| **Operational** | Resilience to incidents like HSM outages, ledger forks, and privacy breaches, with runbooks and reporting aligned with Bank of Russia (FinCERT) and Roskomnadzor requirements. | Develop and test incident response runbooks for key scenarios (HSM outage, key compromise, data breach) with clear notification timelines for all relevant regulators. |

### Strategic Priorities & Next Steps

1. **Secure a Compliant Technology Stack**: Prioritize the selection and procurement of a domestic, FSB-certified Hardware Security Module (HSM) and a DLT platform that can be integrated with GOST cryptography. 
2. **Establish Legal and Compliance Framework**: Engage legal experts to draft the Information System Rules for submission to the Bank of Russia. Concurrently, develop the internal AML/CFT control rules required by Law 115-FZ. 
3. **Design for EQES Integration**: Architect the platform's user onboarding and transaction workflows around the mandatory use of Enhanced Qualified Electronic Signatures (EQES) from the outset. 
4. **Develop Core DvP Settlement Logic**: Design and prototype the atomic Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) mechanism, including the smart contract escrow logic and the ISO 20022-based API integration with a partner settlement bank. 

## 1. Регуляторная база и «точки провала»

The path to launching a DFA platform in Russia is a gauntlet of regulatory compliance. Four federal laws form a "minefield" where a single misstep can end a project: 259-FZ (on DFAs), 115-FZ (on AML/CFT), 63-FZ (on Electronic Signatures), and 242-FZ (on Data Localization). The primary obstacle is the mandatory FSB certification for any system using cryptography, which dictates the entire technology strategy.

### 1.1 ГОСТ-крипто + ФСБ сертификат: чек-лист прохода

Any platform handling legally significant financial operations must use Russian national cryptographic standards (GOST). This is a non-negotiable requirement for DFA operators. The key standards are:
* **Digital Signature:** GOST R 34.10-2012
* **Hash Function:** GOST R 34.11-2012
* **Symmetric Encryption:** GOST R 34.12-2015 ('Kuznyechik' or 'Magma')

Compliance requires integrating with Cryptographic Information Protection Tools (SKZI) that are certified by the Federal Security Service (FSB). In practice, this means using domestic Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) from vendors like CryptoPro or InfoTeCS, which have the necessary FSB certification (e.g., class KB or KB2) and provide hardware implementations of GOST algorithms. 

### 1.2 СКЭП/МЧД workflow: от выдачи до LTV штампа

The use of an Enhanced Qualified Electronic Signature (EQES, or УКЭП/KEP) is legally equivalent to a handwritten signature and is mandatory for critical DFA platform actions. [electronic_signature_integration_guide.legal_basis[0]][2] The legal framework is built on Federal Law No. 63-FZ 'On Electronic Signature' and Federal Law No. 259-FZ, which mandates that the decision to issue a DFA be signed with an EQES. 

The workflow is complex:
1. **Identity-to-Certificate Binding**: The Certification Authority (CA)—exclusively the Bank of Russia's CA for heads of financial organizations—performs identity verification before issuing an EQES certificate. 
2. **Certificate-to-Account Binding**: The user signs a message containing their on-ledger address with their EQES private key, creating a non-repudiable link. 
3. **Corporate Consent**: An employee acting for a company must use their personal EQES along with a Machine-Readable Power of Attorney (MЧД), a separate XML file signed by the company's director. 
4. **Long-Term Validity (LTV)**: To ensure a signature is verifiable after its certificate expires, it must be enhanced at creation with a qualified timestamp and proof of certificate validity (OCSP/CRL). 

### 1.3 AML/CFT правила: матрица риск-скоринга и SLA STR

DFA platform operators are "obliged entities" under Federal Law No. 115-FZ, the foundational AML/CFT legislation. This requires a comprehensive AML/CFT program supervised by the Bank of Russia and reporting to Rosfinmonitoring (the FIU).

Key components include:
* **Risk-Scoring Model**: A mandated risk-based approach requires platforms to develop models assessing Customer Risk (KYC), Asset Risk, and Transaction Risk (KYT). 
* **Mandatory Controls**: All transactions at or exceeding **600,000 RUB** are subject to mandatory control. 
* **Sanctions Screening**: Platforms must screen against Rosfinmonitoring's official list of terrorists/extremists and identify PEPs. 
* **Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) SLA**: Upon identifying a suspicious transaction, a report must be filed with Rosfinmonitoring **"no later than the next working day."** This strict deadline necessitates an efficient, automated alert triage and case management system.

### 1.4 Data-residency и персональные данные (152-ФЗ, 242-ФЗ)

Russian data protection laws impose severe constraints. Federal Law No. 242-FZ mandates that the initial collection, recording, and storage of personal data of Russian citizens must occur in databases physically located within the Russian Federation. Federal Law No. 152-FZ imposes strict controls on any subsequent cross-border data transfers. Any platform architecture, including for implementing the Travel Rule, must be designed for full compliance with these localization requirements. 

## 2. Выбор реестра: Fabric vs Besu vs Masterchain

While both Hyperledger Fabric and permissioned Ethereum clients are technically viable for a DFA platform, the choice is ultimately dictated by sanctions risk and the non-negotiable requirement for GOST cryptography support. Performance is a key differentiator, but compliance and geopolitical resilience are the deciding factors. The term 'Audit-core' is a misnomer in the Russian context and does not refer to a specific technology; it should be excluded from consideration. 

| Feature | Hyperledger Fabric | Permissioned Ethereum (Besu/Quorum) | Masterchain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tech Stack** | Modular architecture (channels, chaincode). | Monolithic architecture, EVM-compatible. | Based on Ethereum/Quorum, engineered for GOST. |
| **Production Cases (RU)** | **Atomyze** (one of the first licensed operators). | **Lighthouse** (one of the first licensed operators). | Developed by FinTech Association with Central Bank. |
| **Consensus** | Raft (CFT). | IBFT 2.0 / QBFT (BFT). **Raft is not supported by Besu**. | RAFT. |
| **Performance (TPS)** | **~1,500-3,000 TPS** (Raft). | **~75 TPS** (IBFT). | Not specified. |
| **Privacy** | Private Data Collections (PDCs). | Tessera (deprecated in Besu 25.1+); requires shift to application-layer privacy. | Not specified. |
| **GOST Support** | Requires significant custom integration with a domestic HSM via PKCS#11. | Requires significant custom integration with a domestic HSM via PKCS#11. | **Engineered to use Russian GOST cryptography out-of-the-box.** |
| **Sanctions Risk** | Lower risk (governed by Linux Foundation). | Higher risk (strong ties to US-based ConsenSys). | **Lowest risk** (domestic platform, FSB-certified). |

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Performance vs. Ecosystem:** Hyperledger Fabric with Raft consensus offers substantially higher throughput, making it more suitable for high-volume retail DFA use cases. Permissioned Ethereum (Besu) offers lower performance but benefits from the vast Ethereum developer ecosystem and Solidity talent pool. 
* **Recommendation:** For a new MVP, **Hyperledger Fabric is the marginally less risky open-source choice** due to its more neutral governance. However, **Masterchain is the most compliant and sanctions-resilient option** overall, as it is domestically developed and pre-certified for GOST cryptography. The ultimate decision must be driven by a PoC that proves successful integration with a domestic, FSB-certified HSM. 

## 3. PoC-план: Permissioned Ethereum QBFT + ViPNet HSM

The goal of the Proof of Concept is to de-risk the most critical technical challenge: integrating a permissioned Ethereum client with Russia's mandatory cryptographic and security infrastructure. The PoC should be time-boxed to a maximum of 6 weeks, focusing on a go/no-go decision for the chosen ledger. The target is not a feature-complete prototype, but a validation of the core compliance-driven architecture.

### 3.1 Архитектура: schema + custom genesis

The PoC will consist of a private, permissioned network of at least four Hyperledger Besu nodes to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance. [permissioned_ethereum_poc_plan.architecture_overview[0]][3]
* **Consensus:** The network will use **QBFT (Quebec Byzantine Fault Tolerance)**, as it is the recommended protocol for enterprise use. RAFT is not supported by Hyperledger Besu. 
* **Configuration:** A custom genesis file will define the network's `chainID` and QBFT parameters, such as `blockperiodseconds` (e.g., 5 seconds) and `requesttimeoutseconds`. 
* **Security:** A key test will be integrating with an external key management system (simulating a domestic HSM) via Besu's `--security-module` option. [permissioned_ethereum_poc_plan.architecture_overview[1]][4]
* **Privacy:** The PoC must pivot away from the now-deprecated Tessera private transaction manager. A dedicated research task must be included to evaluate and test alternative **application-layer privacy solutions**. 
* **Infrastructure:** To comply with data residency laws, the PoC must be deployed on a domestic Russian cloud provider (e.g., Yandex Cloud, SberCloud, VK Cloud). 

### 3.2 Тест-кейсы: Эмиссия, ДвП, Anchoring, fault-injection

The research revealed an information gap regarding detailed test scenarios. A primary activity within the PoC will be to develop and execute these tests. 
* **DFA Emission:** Test the creation of a DFA, ensuring the issuance decision is signed with a GOST-compliant signature.
* **Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP):** Simulate the core DvP flow, including locking an asset in a smart contract and releasing it upon a mock payment confirmation.
* **Anchoring:** Test the process of creating a Merkle root of on-chain transactions and simulating its publication to an external system.
* **Fault Injection:** Design and execute tests that simulate node crashes and validator failures to evaluate the resilience of the QBFT consensus mechanism. 

### 3.3 Go/No-Go KPI: TPS≥50, latency p95 < 2с, 0 фатальных форков

Clear go/no-go criteria must be defined as part of the PoC planning phase, as none were found in the initial research. The PoC will be considered successful if it meets the following minimum criteria:
* **Performance:** Achieves a stable throughput of at least **50 TPS** with a p95 end-to-end latency of less than **2 seconds** for a standard DFA transfer.
* **Stability:** Experiences **zero fatal ledger forks** or unrecoverable consensus failures during fault injection testing.
* **Compliance:** Demonstrates successful generation and verification of a GOST R 34.10-2012 signature for a transaction using a PKCS#11 interface to a simulated HSM.

### 3.4 Ресурсы: Yandex Cloud vs on-prem, бюджет, команда

The PoC will require a dedicated team and infrastructure.
* **Infrastructure:** A Linux-based environment with a compatible JDK (e.g., JDK 17+) is required for Besu. Deployment on a Russian cloud provider is recommended for speed and compliance.
* **Team:** The team will need expertise in Ethereum, Solidity, Java, and infrastructure automation. Given the talent shortage, partnering with a local system integrator is highly recommended.
* **Deliverables:** The PoC should produce reproducible deployment scripts (e.g., Helm charts), CI/CD pipeline jobs, comprehensive logs and metrics, and captured evidence of all test scenarios. 

## 4. Интеграция СКЭП и mTLS GOST

In the Russian DFA ecosystem, the signature is law. Every legally significant action must be cryptographically signed using an Enhanced Qualified Electronic Signature (EQES/KEP) that complies with Federal Law 63-FZ and GOST standards. Losing a key is equivalent to a complete halt in trading.

### 4.1 Провайдеры и SDK (CryptoPro, SKB Контур, Tensor, Infotecs)

Several major Russian vendors provide the necessary tools for integrating EQES capabilities. The choice of provider will depend on the specific application architecture (client-side vs. server-side signing).

| Vendor | Key Products | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CryptoPro** | CryptoPro CSP, CryptoPro JCP, CryptoPro DSS | Offers a comprehensive suite including a client-side cryptographic provider (CSP), a Java library (JCP), and a server-side REST API for cloud signing (DSS). [electronic_signature_integration_guide.api_sdks[0]][5] |
| **SKB Kontur** | Kontur.Kripto SDK, Cloud Signature API | Provides an SDK for client-side integration and a cloud-based API for server-side operations. |
| **Tensor (SBIS)** | Cloud Signature API | Focuses on a cloud signature API for integration into third-party systems. |
| **Infotecs** | ViPNet CSP SDK | Provides a client-side cryptographic service provider SDK. |

### 4.2 HSM хранение ключей: ViPNet 8 vs CryptoPro HSM 2.0

Private keys for EQES must be stored in non-extractable, FSB-certified Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). The two leading domestic options are from InfoTeCS and CryptoPro.

| Feature | InfoTeCS ViPNet HSM version 8 | CryptoPro HSM 2.0 R3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vendor** | InfoTeCS [domestic_hsm_and_mpc_options.vendor[0]][6] | CryptoPro |
| **FSB Certification** | Yes (SF/124-5236, valid until 2028-05-01). | Yes, certified. |
| **GOST Support** | Comprehensive support for GOST R 34.10-2012, 34.11-2012, 34.12-2015, 34.13-2015. [domestic_hsm_and_mpc_options.gost_support[0]][7] | Comprehensive GOST support. |
| **Integration** | PKCS#11 supported. [domestic_hsm_and_mpc_options.pkcs11_supported[0]][8] Direct integration with ViPNet PKI Service. | PKCS#11 supported. |
| **Performance** | Described as 'high-performance' but no public benchmarks found. [domestic_hsm_and_mpc_options.performance_notes[0]][6] | Described as 'highly productive' but no public benchmarks found. [sanctions_resilient_technology_stack.hsm_component[0]][5] |

**Note on MPC:** Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is not a viable option for regulated DFA use cases in Russia at this time, as there are no domestic, GOST-compliant, or certified MPC products. A certified HSM is the only compliant path. 

### 4.3 Runbook инцидента: компрометация, отзыв, перезагрузка

A key compromise is a critical incident. The runbook must be clear and immediate.
* **Detection:** Monitor for anomalous signing activity and respond to user reports.
* **Containment:** Immediately contact the issuing CA (e.g., Bank of Russia's CA) to initiate certificate revocation, as required by Federal Law 63-FZ. The key owner must notify the CA within one business day. 
* **Recovery:** Generate a new key pair in the HSM, obtain a new EQES certificate, and securely deploy it. All transactions signed with the compromised key must be reviewed. 

## 5. DvP 15-минут: ISO 20022 + Smart-Escrow

Achieving atomic Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) between an on-chain DFA and off-chain RUB is feasible within a 15-minute SLA. The solution relies on a hybrid model where an off-chain "Coordinator" service orchestrates the interaction between the DLT and the banking system via ISO 20022 messages.

### 5.1 Sequence diagram + End-to-End ID

The recommended model is an 'On-Ledger Smart Contract Escrow with a Notary/Coordinator Service'. 
1. **Trade Agreed:** Seller locks their DFAs in a smart contract escrow on the DLT. The contract contains trade details and a timeout (e.g., **1800 seconds**).
2. **Payment Initiation:** The off-chain Coordinator service, operated by the platform, confirms the DFA lock and sends a `pacs.008.001.06` message to the settlement bank to initiate the RUB transfer. A unique **End-to-End ID** is generated and included in both the smart contract and the `pacs.008` message to link the two legs. 
3. **Payment Confirmation:** The Coordinator listens for a `camt.054` (BankToCustomerDebitCreditNotification) message from the bank, which confirms the funds have been credited. 
4. **Asset Release:** Upon receiving the `camt.054`, the Coordinator calls the 'release' function on the smart contract, transferring the DFAs to the buyer.

### 5.2 Таймауты, откаты, pacs.002/pacs.004 exception-flow

The system must be designed for atomicity by handling exceptions gracefully.
* **Payment Rejection:** If the bank rejects the payment (e.g., insufficient funds), it sends a `pacs.002` rejection or a `pacs.004` (PaymentReturn). The Coordinator receives this and triggers the smart contract to immediately return the DFAs to the seller. 
* **Timeout:** If no `camt.054` is received within the SLA (e.g., 30 minutes), the smart contract's timeout function automatically reverts the DFA transfer. The Coordinator then initiates a `camt.056` (CancellationRequest) to recall the funds. 

### 5.3 EOD-сверка по camt.053 и on-chain хешам

Reconciliation operates on two levels to ensure ledger integrity.
* **Real-time:** The Coordinator continuously matches outgoing `pacs.008` instructions with incoming `camt.054` confirmations using the End-to-End ID. 
* **End-of-Day:** The platform operator performs a batch reconciliation, comparing the daily `camt.053` bank statement against the platform's on-chain record of all completed DFA transfers. 

## 6. Secondary Market: RFQ-FIX сегодня, CLOB завтра

A phased approach to building the secondary market is recommended. An RFQ-based model is sufficient for an MVP and ideal for the current illiquid market, with a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) planned for when market volume grows.

### 6.1 FIX-сообщения и роли (QuoteRequest→ExecutionReport)

The API should be based on the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol.
* **Workflow:** A `PriceTaker` sends a `QuoteRequest` (MsgType=R). `MarketMaker`s respond with `Quote` (MsgType=S) messages. The taker accepts by sending a `NewOrderSingle` (MsgType=D) referencing the `QuoteID`. The platform confirms with `ExecutionReport` (MsgType=8) to both parties. 
* **Roles:** Granular roles must be defined: `PriceTaker`, `MarketMaker`, `Auditor` (read-only for regulators), and `Administrator`. 

### 6.2 Контроль лимитов 600 k₽ и квалификации инвестора

Compliance gates are critical. The platform must enforce investor qualification status as per Federal Law 259-FZ.
* **Qualified Investors:** Unrestricted access.
* **Non-Qualified Investors:** Banned from complex DFAs and subject to an annual investment limit of **600,000 rubles**. 

These checks must be performed by the trading engine at the pre-trade stage, along with screening against PEP/sanctions lists (per 115-FZ) and monitoring for market abuse (per 224-FZ). 

### 6.3 Аудит-лог: неизменяемое хранение 5 лет

As mandated by Federal Law 259-FZ, the platform operator must store all information about transactions and participants for a minimum of **five years**. [platform_compliance_checklist.data_retention_years[0]][9] The audit trail must be immutable and capture every event in sufficient detail to allow for a full reconstruction of any trade. 

## 7. Технологический стек без санкций

Building a sanctions-resilient stack means eliminating all dependencies on Western commercial software and using self-hosted, open-source tools deployed on certified domestic infrastructure. The goal is to create a "technological fortress" that can operate independently.

| Component | Recommended Tooling | Rationale / Sanctions Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DLT Ledger** | **Masterchain** or a self-hosted **Hyperledger Fabric** fork. | Masterchain is FSB-certified and uses GOST crypto natively. [sanctions_resilient_technology_stack.dlt_component[0]][10] Fabric is governed by the Linux Foundation, reducing single-vendor risk. Avoid unmodified Besu/Quorum due to ConsenSys (US) ties. |
| **Signature** | **EQES/KEP** via Russian-accredited CAs (e.g., Bank of Russia's CA). | Legally mandated by Federal Law 63-FZ. Ensures legal validity and non-repudiation within the Russian legal system. |
| **HSM** | **CryptoPro HSM 2.0 R3** or **InfoTeCS ViPNet HSM**. | Mandatory use of domestic, FSB-certified HSMs for key protection. These products are certified and support GOST algorithms. |
| **Messaging** | **SPFS** (System for Transfer of Financial Messages) and Bank of Russia payment rails (BESP, SBP). | Sovereign alternative to SWIFT, ensuring domestic and potentially cross-border (BRICS) payment processing. [sanctions_resilient_technology_stack.messaging_component[0]][11] |
| **Observability** | **Metrics:** Prometheus + VictoriaMetrics + Grafana. <br> **Logging:** Grafana Loki or OpenSearch. | Self-hosted, open-source stack avoids licensing and sanctions risk from vendors like Datadog or Splunk. |
| **SIEM** | **Kaspersky KUMA** or **Positive Technologies MaxPatrol SIEM**. | For compliance, logs must be fed into an FSTEC-certified domestic SIEM. These are the leading certified options. |
| **CI/CD** | **GitLab CE/Gitea** (source), **Jenkins/GitLab CI** (automation), **Harbor/Nexus OSS** (artifacts). | A fully self-hosted, open-source pipeline eliminates reliance on sanctioned platforms like GitHub or Docker Hub. |
| **OS Platform** | **Astra Linux** or **RED OS**. | The entire stack must be deployed on an FSTEC-certified Russian Linux distribution to comply with critical infrastructure regulations. |

### 7.2 SBoM и supply-chain-сканирование (Syft/Grype)

In line with emerging best practices from Russian regulators (FSTEC, MinTsifry), the CI/CD pipeline must integrate Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) generation and analysis. This involves using open-source tools like Syft and Grype to create SBoMs and automatically scan all dependencies for known vulnerabilities, mitigating open-source supply chain risks. 

## 8. Инцидент-менеджмент: от форка до DLP-алерта

Incident response must be swift and compliant with strict regulatory notification timelines. Failure to report on time results in fines and reputational damage.

### 8.1 Топ-5 сценариев + RTO/RPO

| Incident Scenario | Detection & Recovery Runbook |
| :--- | :--- |
| **EQES Key Compromise** | **Detect:** Anomalous signing. **Contain:** Immediately contact CA to revoke certificate. **Recover:** Generate new key, obtain new certificate, re-sign affected documents. |
| **HSM Outage** | **Detect:** Monitoring alerts. **Recover:** Automatic failover to standby HSM in HA cluster. If failover fails, manually redirect traffic or activate DR site. Engage domestic vendor for support. |
| **Ledger Fork** | **Detect:** Mismatch in block hashes across nodes. **Contain:** Halt new transactions. Isolate minority chain nodes. **Recover:** Determine canonical chain, wipe forked nodes, and resynchronize from a trusted peer. |
| **Privacy Breach** | **Detect:** SIEM/DLP alerts. **Contain:** Isolate systems, take forensic snapshots. **Notify:** Roskomnadzor (24h), FinCERT, and affected subjects. **Remediate:** Patch, reset credentials, restore from backup. |
| **AML Alert Surge** | **Detect:** Alert queue volume exceeds capacity. **Triage:** Prioritize critical alerts (e.g., sanctions matches). **Report:** Continue filing SARs within the "next working day" deadline and proactively communicate with Rosfinmonitoring. |

### 8.2 Пост-инцидент: форензика, аудит, улучшения

A mandatory post-incident review is required for all incidents. The process involves a thorough forensic analysis to determine the root cause, followed by implementing corrective actions such as software patches, configuration changes, and updates to security controls. All documentation related to the incident must be retained for a minimum of three years. 

## 9. Конкурентная карта 12-6-3

The Russian DFA market is an oligopoly of state-linked banks and major financial institutions. As of late 2025, there are at least 12 operational platforms, with several more in the pipeline. The high barriers to entry, driven by complex regulation and the need for FSB certification, have created a protected market that favors large, well-capitalized domestic players.

### 9.1 Таблица: статус, стек, объём эмиссий

### 9.3 Ниши возможностей для нового игрока

Despite the dominance of large banks, opportunities exist. The market's fragmentation means there is no unified system for cross-platform asset access. A new player could focus on:
* **Niche Asset Classes:** Targeting specific, underserved asset types not prioritized by the major banks.
* **Superior UX/Tooling:** Providing a better user experience for issuers and investors.
* **Interoperability Hub:** Building a platform designed to bridge liquidity and connect the existing silos, acting as a "market of markets."

## 10. Дорожная карта 12 месяцев до MVP-запуска

The path to a compliant MVP launch is a 12-month journey, divided into three main phases: foundations and compliance, core development, and integration and testing.

### 10.3 Риски и планы их снижения

The project faces significant risks that must be proactively managed.
* **Sanctions Risk:** Mitigated by a strict "domestic-first" technology policy and designing for parallel settlement rails (commercial bank money and the Digital Ruble). 
* **Compliance Risk:** Mitigated by proactive engagement with specialized legal counsel from day one and building the platform for auditability with immutable logging. 
* **Technical Risk:** Mitigated by mandatory PoC and load testing to establish performance baselines, and partnering with system integrators to address the talent shortage.
