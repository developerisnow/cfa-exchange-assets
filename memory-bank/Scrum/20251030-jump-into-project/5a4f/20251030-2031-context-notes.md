Why → What → How → Result

Yury nuances (people/process)
- Drives hard on rate, prefers low initial burn; fair but requires structure to avoid drift
- Prepay works; keep credit ledger visible; lock 2-week increments; written decisions only
- Wants speed via code reuse and agents; still needs governance to prevent scope creep

Intro call insights
- Goal: ОИС ЦФА “Капитал” with issuance + secondary market; prefers permissioned consensus he controls
- Has PHP BitChange code; open to reuse; also open to spec-first greenfield
- Admin/legal team already active; tech team to be formed (you + Alexander)

Telegram thread themes
- Interest in agentic tooling, rapid prototyping, and practical ROI
- Willing to iterate publicly with diagrams and context artifacts

Outsource estimation takeaways
- Sound modular architecture: API GW, event bus, domain services, DLT/ledger, compliance, custody, payments
- Non-func targets reasonable: 2–5k rps, 200–500 tps events, 99.95% core availability
- MVP can be sliced to Identity, Issuer, Custody, Settlement-lite, Ledger trail, Admin UI

Artefacts 20251022
- Platform functionality tables extracted from Excel define UI screens and core domain fields
- CFA platforms status landscape: ~12 active, key players Sber, Atomize, Lighthouse, NRD

Your thoughts alignment
- Sanctions/BRICS constraints → avoid US/UE dependencies; consider Fabric/Besu or immudb; evaluate Cosmos/Polkadot analogs only as references
- DEX-like secondary trading later; MVP focus on primary issuance and DvP settlement

Risks/Assumptions
- Legal: 63-ФЗ, AML requirements; need KEP integration; sanctions screening
- Technical: ledger choice impacts everything; avoid overengineering; keep append-only journal even with DLT
- Organizational: rate/budget alignment; need clear DoR/DoD + weekly cadence
