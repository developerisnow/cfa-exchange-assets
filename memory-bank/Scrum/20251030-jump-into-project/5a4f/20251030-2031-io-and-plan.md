TL;DR
- Manifest missing: polymarket.manifest.core.json not found. Request fix/ok to proceed without.
- Read key context: Yury profile, intro call, Telegram log, MVP vision, outsource estimation, artefacts.
- Proposed 10-day MVP discovery plan + crisp next actions to unblock execution.

Steps
1) Confirm manifest path or allow bypass this sprint
2) Lock scope for MVP-0.1 (Identity, Issuer, Custody, DvP lite, Ledger trail)
3) Align on tech stack decision tree (Fabric vs Besu vs immudb; PHP reuse vs greenfield)
4) Produce C4 Context+Containers, sequence for DvP, data model v0
5) Delivery plan: roles, budget, milestones (2-week cadence)
6) Legal/Compliance checklist (63-ФЗ, AML/KYC, storage, audit trail)
7) Integrations shortlist (payments, KEP/eID, sanctions lists)
8) Risk register + decision log
9) Prototype flows: issue, subscribe, settle
10) Kickoff + weekly governance cadence

Table — What/Why/How/Result
| What | Why | How | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manifest fix | Unblocks rules/schemas pipeline | Provide/correct `polymarket.manifest.core.json` or greenlight bypass | Repo sanity + linter path |
| MVP-0.1 scope | Fast path to value | 5 core domains only | Demo-able flow end-to-end |
| Tech choices | Reduce rework risk | Compare Fabric/Besu vs immudb anchor; code reuse vs greenfield | Signed decision doc |
| Governance | Keep Yury aligned | Weekly 45m, decision log, DoR/DoD | Fewer misalignments |
| Security baseline | Regulator-ready path | mTLS, key mgmt policy, audit trail | No later rewrites |

Next actions
- P0: Provide core manifest or approve bypass for this iteration
- P1: 90‑min architecture workshop (Yury + Alexander): confirm MVP boundaries and constraints
- P1: Share BitChange PHP repo snapshot for reuse assessment (read‑only audit)
- P1: Approve stack shortlist to evaluate: {Hyperledger Fabric, Besu, immudb+anchor}
- P2: Approve 10‑day discovery plan and budget guardrails

Notes — Key decisions to make
- Ledger layer: permissioned DLT (Fabric/Besu) vs append-only store + external anchoring (immudb + periodic notarization)
- DvP rail: tokenized cash vs bank rails (НСПК/СБП) for MVP; atomicity guarantees
- PHP reuse: BitChange code audit for auth/session, basic UI, not matching engine
- Custody: HSM vs MPC baseline; key ceremony and recovery
- Identity: KYC/KYB providers, KEP/eID integration approach
