### Final Daily Report — 2025-11-20 — Alex A

## Sprint Closure (2025-11-20)
- `infra.defis.deploy` now contains NX-01 docs/spec fixes, NX-03 issuance 404 bugfix, NX-05 issuer dashboard backend/UI, NX-06 payout schedule spec+UI, and NX-08 backoffice audit log UI.
- Verified that Issuance publish tests pass after the new nullable service contract and InMemory provider toggle.
- Portal Issuer + Backoffice deliverables wired to the new reporting endpoints; Audit feature merged after lint/build validation.
- NX-07 (Backoffice KYC/User Registry) remains in progress and is explicitly moved to next sprint for focused delivery.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy `infra.defis.deploy` to UK1 and run E2E smoke (issuer dashboard, payouts, audit log) against the refreshed stack.
2. Continue NX-07 implementation using the new branch as baseline, ensuring compliance flows get parity with NX-05/06 frontend patterns.
